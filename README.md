PLANT DESCRIPTION.

Rosemary is an evergreen plant,shrubby herb that grows to aheight of 1 to 2m
With a unique a romantic odour and acamphoraceous undertone.

Much of the volatile essential oils reside in their calyces.

CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS.

1.temperature
 
 It grows well at day temperature of 20 to 25Â°c
 
 It is very adaptable and is grown in almost all regions.

2.Rainfall

 Mostly grown under dryland conditions.
 
 When under irrigation care should be taken not to over irrigate.
 
 In wetter areas rosemary will not do as well unless ridged to allow excess water to drain away.
 
 SOIL REQUIREMENTS.

 Well drained sandy to clay loam soil.
 
 Soil pH range of 5,5 to 8,0 is required.
 
 Aclay percentage of 30% maximum can be tolerated by the plant.
 
 CULTIVATION PRACTICES.

1.Propagation.
  
  Rosemary is propagated by means of:

-seeds.

-cuttings.

-layering or division of roots.

 Seeds germinate very slowly.as there is always aproblem of cross pollination, growing true-to-type plants from seeds is not a good practice unless controlled properly.
 
 
 Cuttings from actively growing stem tips are good way to propagate new plants efficiently,
 
 Cuttings of 10 to 15cm length are taken.
 
 The bottom two thirds are stripped from leaves.
 
 The cutting is inserted in a proper growing medium.,half two thirds of length.
 
 Rooting hormones will assist in root formation within 2 to 4 weeks.
 
 A mist bed with a heated floor will give the best results.

 Layering maybe accomplished readily in summer by pegging some of the lower branches under a little sand soil.
 
 After roots have formed the plants can then be severed frm the parent plant.

 2.Soil preparation.
   
   Rosemary doesn't grow well in waterlogged or high clay soils.
   
   If the clay percentage of the soil is too high,application of gravel stones with a diameter of 1 to 2.5cm can be made that can be worked into the soil before planting.
   
   This will assist in aeration of the roots.
   
   Other practices of incorporation of good compost will also be beneficial.
   
   Herbal and essential oil crops grown on natural soils yield products that are high quality and in demand globally.
   
   General soil preparation guidelines.

   -take soil samples according to correct guidelines.
