# Rosemary-growing

 - Rosemary plant,is amedicinal plant which is drought resistant ,used to make over 45 health products.

 - The scientific name is Rosemarinus of final is.

 - The common name is Rosemary.

 - The family is Labiatae.

 - It's of Mediterranean origin.

 - Internationally the leading regions of rosemary production are the Mediterranean countries,Northern Africa,England,Mexico and the USA.

 - Major production areas in south Africa include,maluti mountains in the eastern free state,Gau-teng,Limpopo,Northwest mpumalanga,eastern and western cape provinces.

   PLANT DESCRIPTION.

 - Rosemary is an evergreen plant,shrubby herb that grows to aheight of 1 to 2m
With a unique a romantic odour and acamphoraceous undertone.

 - The erect stems are divided into numerous long,slender branches that have ash coloured and scaly bark.

   LEAVES.

 - The branches bear opposite, leathery thick leaves which are lustrous,linear,dark green above and downy white below.

   FLOWER.

 - The flowers are small and pale blue to deep blue.

 - Much of the volatile essential oils reside in their calyces.

CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS.

1. temperature
 
 - It grows well at day temperature of 20 to 25Â°c
 
 - It is very adaptable and is grown in almost all regions.

2. Rainfall

 - Mostly grown under dryland conditions.
 
 - When under irrigation care should be taken not to over irrigate.
 
 - In wetter areas rosemary will not do as well unless ridged to allow excess water to drain away.
 
   SOIL REQUIREMENTS.

 - Well drained sandy to clay loam soil.
 
 - Soil pH range of 5,5 to 8,0 is required.
 
 - Aclay percentage of 30% maximum can be tolerated by the plant.
 
   CULTIVATION PRACTICES.

1. Propagation.
  
  Rosemary is propagated by means of:

 - seeds.

 - cuttings.

 - layering or division of roots.

 - Seeds germinate very slowly.as there is always aproblem of cross pollination, growing true-to-type plants from seeds is not a good practice unless controlled properly.
 
 
 - Cuttings from actively growing stem tips are good way to propagate new plants efficiently,
 
 - Cuttings of 10 to 15cm length are taken.
 
 - The bottom two thirds are stripped from leaves.
 
 - The cutting is inserted in a proper growing medium.,half two thirds of length.
 
 - Rooting hormones will assist in root formation within 2 to 4 weeks.
 
 - A mist bed with a heated floor will give the best results.

 - Layering maybe accomplished readily in summer by pegging some of the lower branches under a little sand soil.
 
 - After roots have formed the plants can then be severed frm the parent plant.

 2. Soil preparation.
   
  -  Rosemary doesn't grow well in waterlogged or high clay soils.
   
  - If the clay percentage of the soil is too high,application of gravel stones with a diameter of 1 to 2.5cm can be made that can be worked into the soil before planting.
   
  - This will assist in aeration of the roots.
   
  - Other practices of incorporation of good compost will also be beneficial.
   
  - Herbal and essential oil crops grown on natural soils yield products that are high quality and in demand globally.
   
    General soil preparation guidelines.

  - take soil samples according to correct guidelines.
  
  - have the soil analysed at a laboratory that will be able to check for mineral deficiencies and excesses,organic status and carbon ratios.
  
  - A soil analysis will guide the producer in correcting the nutritional status of the soil in order to provide the crop with optimum growing conditions such as a balanced mineral status and correct pH.
  
  - Soil fertility levels have to be with in acceptable ranges before a soil building programme is started.
  
  - Correct the soil pH according to analysis and soil type.
   
  - Fertiliser use has to be planned according to whether the crop will be grown inorganically or organically.
 
  - Soil preparation has to be done according to good cultivation practices.
  
  - Apply suitable soil preparation practices according to the farming operation.(rip,plough,disc,harrow,contour,etc)
